// Making is the lock that says a VM is being made: each devvm making a
// VM, or giving one new shared tools, holds it shared (Hold) from before
// it picks the tools until the VM's state lists them, and devvm gc --tool-images
// and retention's tools.unused-age take it alone (Exclude), so they never
// delete a tool image such a VM may not list yet. It's an OS lock on a
// file in devvm's data folder (Dirs.MakingLock): the OS lets go of it
// when the process holding it ends, however it ends, and the processes
// devvm starts don't inherit it.
