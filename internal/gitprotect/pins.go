// On a Linux host, a start pins what a lock covers in the namespace the
// VM's QEMU runs in (Binds). A pin covers one name of a file, so a file
// with another name (a hard link) can't be pinned, and the start is
// refused; a file that git on the host renames over a pinned one is the
// guest's to change until it's pinned again, which the namespace records
// (backend.PinEvent) and ReportPinEvents names, as the watch names what
// changed. A running VM's pins are checked as it runs (PinsMissing).

// Pins are what the start of the VM vm pins for its locks (Binds), in the
// folder's own repo and each nested repo its state records protecting,
// none unless its mode is on or strict, each relative to the project folder and
// a real path in it (realInDir), as lock takes them: .git, when it's a
// folder, and the git dirs a lock covers besides (fixed), which the guest
// can write in but not rename or remove, and each path a lock covers that
// is there (readOnly), which it can't change. lock made a missing hooks
// folder and config.worktree while the VM was stopped. A file to pin, or
// a hook in a hooks folder to pin, with another name is refused
// (git_pin_linked): its other name would stay the guest's to change.
