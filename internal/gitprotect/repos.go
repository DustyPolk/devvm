// A VM's protection covers each repo in its folder: the folder's own, and,
// once Made.Nested is set, each repo nested in it, a tree of its own whose
// top folder is below the folder. A check of a stopped VM takes the
// nested repos the walk found (Protector.Nested), the ones it recorded
// first; any other check takes those it recorded, so a launch into a
// running VM never walks. Each repo is scanned (scanAll), at most scanners
// at once, and a nested repo whose git dir another repo's protection
// covers, such as a submodule's, is left to that one.

// scanners is how many repos scanAll scans at once: each scan runs a few
