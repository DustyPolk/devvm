Build an image and the images under it, unless they're built

## Synopsis

Build an image and the images under it, unless they're built, and the shared tool images it names that aren't. IMAGE is base, or layers (devvm's docker and nix, your own) joined with +, bottom first (foo+bar is bar on foo on base), with any shared tools (node+foo+claude).

## Options inherited from parent commands

```text
      --backend NAME        the NAME of the backend a new VM or image gets (default: the default backend file's, else lima)
      --cpus N              the N CPUs a new VM gets (default: the size file's, else the image's)
      --disk GiB            a new VM's disk in GiB, at least the image's (default: the size file's, else the image's)
      --from IMAGE          the container IMAGE a new VM's or image's base starts from instead of Ubuntu's cloud image: node:24, debian:13, ghcr.io/org/image@sha256:… (default: $DEVVM_FROM's)
      --memory GiB          a new VM's memory in GiB: 16, 16G or 16GiB (default: the size file's, else the image's)
      --network-policy      create the VM with network policy: it reaches only the hosts you allow, through a proxy on this machine, and your secrets stay on this machine (default: on, asked in a terminal)
      --no-network-policy   create the VM without network policy: it reaches anything this machine can
      --ports PORTS         which PORTS a new VM forwards to this machine's localhost: all, none, or a list like 5173,8000-8010 (default: the ports file's, else all)
