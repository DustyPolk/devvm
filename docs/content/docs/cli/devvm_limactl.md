Run Lima's limactl on devvm's own Lima home

## Synopsis

Run limactl with ARGS on devvm's own Lima home, where the lima backend's VMs and images live, in devvm's place: its input, output and exit code are limactl's, and every argument is passed on, flags and --help included. It runs in devvm's data folder, so give it files by absolute path. A VM started this way runs unconfined, without its network policy (devvm ls shows it unenforced): start VMs with devvm.

## Options inherited from parent commands

```text
      --backend NAME        the NAME of the backend a new VM or image gets (default: the default backend file's, else lima)
      --cpus N              the N CPUs a new VM gets (default: the size file's, else the image's)
      --disk GiB            a new VM's disk in GiB, at least the image's (default: the size file's, else the image's)
      --from IMAGE          the container IMAGE a new VM's or image's base starts from instead of Ubuntu's cloud image: node:24, debian:13, ghcr.io/org/image@sha256:… (default: $DEVVM_FROM's)
      --memory GiB          a new VM's memory in GiB: 16, 16G or 16GiB (default: the size file's, else the image's)
      --network-policy      create the VM with network policy: it reaches only the hosts you allow, through a proxy on this machine, and your secrets stay on this machine (default: devvm network -g's, else asked in a terminal, and on without one)
      --no-network-policy   create the VM without network policy: it reaches anything this machine can
      --ports PORTS         which PORTS a new VM forwards to this machine's localhost: all, none, or a list like 5173,8000-8010 (default: the ports file's, else all)
