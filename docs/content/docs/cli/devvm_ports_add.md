Forward more ports from this folder's VM

## Synopsis

Add LIST's ports and ranges (5173,8000-8010) to those this folder's VM forwards, or with -g to those new VMs forward. A VM that forwards every port keeps doing so.

```text
      --backend NAME        the NAME of the backend a new VM or image gets (default: the default backend file's, else lima)
      --cpus N              the N CPUs a new VM gets (default: the size file's, else the image's)
      --disk GiB            a new VM's disk in GiB, at least the image's (default: the size file's, else the image's)
      --from IMAGE          the container IMAGE a new VM's or image's base starts from instead of Ubuntu's cloud image: node:24, debian:13, ghcr.io/org/image@sha256:… (default: $DEVVM_FROM's)
  -g, --global              show or change what new VMs forward instead

      --network-policy      create the VM with network policy: it reaches only the hosts you allow, through a proxy on this machine, and your secrets stay on this machine (default: devvm network -g's, else asked in a terminal, and on without one)
      --no-network-policy   create the VM without network policy: it reaches anything this machine can
      --ports PORTS         which PORTS a new VM forwards to this machine's localhost: all, none, or a list like 5173,8000-8010 (default: the ports file's, else all)
